# DEPRECATED

XmlTag is deprecated. No more development will be taking place.

It was a very nice experiment. I liked that very much, but I don't find myself using it anymore. That's a viable sign that it should be deprecated.

Thanks for all your support!

The easiest way to simplify custom View tags in layout xmls.

Version 1.5 of Android Studio introduced the ability to use the short name of the custom `Views` when code-completing:

 ![ ](/sample/screens/first.png)

but why not take it a step further... and actually **use** the short name of the `CustomView` in your layout xml?

 ![ ](/sample/screens/second.png)
